# Algorithm Implementations in D

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms in the D programming language.

- [x] **Bubble Sort**: [Link to Bubble Sort](bubble_sort.d)
  - A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

- [x] **Merge Sort**: [Link to Merge Sort](merge_sort.d)
  - A divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides the input array into two halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.

- [x] **Insertion Sort**: [Link to Insertion Sort](insertion_sort.d)
  - A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly taking the next unsorted element and inserting it into its correct position in the sorted part of the array.

- [x] **Quick Sort**: [Link to Quick Sort](quick_sort.d)
  - A fast sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach by selecting a "pivot" element and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays.

- [x] **Selection Sort**: [Link to Selection Sort](selection_sort.d)
  - A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the minimum (or maximum) element from the unsorted part of the array and puts it in its correct position in the sorted part.

- [x] **Connected Components using Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: [Link to BFS](bfs_cc.d)
  - An algorithm to find the connected components of an undirected graph using Breadth-First Search (BFS).

- [x] **Connected Components using Depth-First Search (DFS)**: [Link to DFS](dfs_cc.d)
  - An algorithm to find the connected components of an undirected graph using Depth-First Search (DFS).

- [x] **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: [Link to DFS](dfs.d)
  - An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures, starting from the root (or an arbitrary node) and exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

- [x] **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: [Link to BFS](bfs.d)
  - An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures, starting at the root (or an arbitrary node) and exploring neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next level of neighbors.

- [x] **Gift Wrapping (Jarvis March)**: [Link to Gift Wrapping](gift_wrapping.d)
  - An algorithm for finding the convex hull of a set of points in a two-dimensional plane.

- [x] **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: [Link to Dijkstra](dijkstra.d)
  - An algorithm for finding the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.

- [x] **Kruskal's Algorithm**: [Link to Kruskal](kruskal.d)
  - An algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph.

- [x] **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: [Link to Floyd-Warshall](floyd_warshall.d)
  - An algorithm for finding the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph.
